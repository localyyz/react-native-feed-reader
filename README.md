### Note from Localyyz

All code written against this repository will not be used by Localyyz Inc in any
way. All code are for educational purpose only, and will be freely available in
the public domain.

Purpose of this project is to implement a working RSS feed reader with basic
functions such as:

1. add / remove *.rss feeds
2. parse and display titles, thumbnails etc.
3. open and navigate to content within the news reader
4. keep track of unread count since last opened
5. parse and categorize news stories
(more as the project progresses)

Initial tasks are added by @pxue, feel free to claim an issue and start working
on it. Once ready, submit a PR and we can review it together.

Contributors are also more than welcome to open new issues and work on that
instead, providing it's similar complexity as the other issues.
